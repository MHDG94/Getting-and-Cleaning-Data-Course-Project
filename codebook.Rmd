The repository includes "run_analysis.R" which was used getting and cleaning data. 

Step 1: download.file() and unzip() functions were used to download and extract data, resoectively, from "UCI HAR Dataset"

Step 2: Each data was assigned a variable and the variables are: 
 (1) Features 
 (2) Activities 
 (3) Subject_test 
 (4) X_test
 (5) Y_test 
 (6) Subject_Train 
 (7) X_train 
 (8) Y_train 
 
Step 3: Data set was merged using rbind() and cbind() functions followed by extracting the mean and standard deviation using TidyData 
 
Step 5: A label was assigned to each data set: 
 (1) Accelerometer 
 (2) Gyroscope
 (3) Body 
 (4) Magnitude 
 (5) Frequency 
 (6) Time 
 
Finally, the data was observed via FinalData and exported into a text file.
